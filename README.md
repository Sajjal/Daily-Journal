# Welcome

### Thank you for exploring Mr. Sajjal's Journal.

It is a web-based Journal application to keep track of daily personal activities.

This application is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and some basic HTML and CSS. MongoDB is used as a database. The user interface is responsive and minimal.

**Feel free to Clone and Fork. Commercial Distribution is Prohibited.**

## Background (_Why this application was developed?_)

After completing **Covid-19-Analyzer** `https://github.com/Sajjal/Covid-19-Analyzer` I got busy on some personal household activities for a few days. Programming was completely paused. Therefore, I decided to keep it going. I was looking for some ideas to work on and suddenly I noticed a video in my youtube recommendation. The video was from a channel named "**Web Dev Simplified**". Link: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM`.

I got inspired by that particular video and decided to work on a similar project. Although I already have a personal blog built-in WordPress, I thought it will be a good idea to create a web-based journal-app to keep track of daily personal activities. It will also help me to learn the concept of NoSQL database and WYSIWYG editor. So why not?
And here it is.
